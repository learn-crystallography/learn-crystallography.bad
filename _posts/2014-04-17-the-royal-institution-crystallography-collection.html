<p>The Royal Institution in collaboration with STFC have created a Crystallography Collection on their website with a number of videos describing crystallography and diffraction, as well as videos on the history of this important area.</p>
<p>More recently they have created two videos entitled 'Understanding Crystallography: Part 1 and 2'.  These are great videos, the first of which features Professor Elspeth Garman from the University of Oxford, our past BCA president, talking about how we go from protein production and purirfication through to crystallisation.  The second takes these crystals, and explains how we then use facilities such as the Diamond Light Source to obtain structural information about these crystals.  This video features Professor Stephen Curry from Imperial College London.</p>
<p>There are a number of great videos on their website, so check them out...</p>
