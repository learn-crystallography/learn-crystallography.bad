<p>The father and son team who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1915 “for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays”. You don’t need to be a Nobel Laureate to take part; <strong>Stephen Soanes</strong> has kindly <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/knowledge/science/two-braggs-crystallography-quiz">put together a quiz (just for fun)</a> – you may learn something new about these two scientists.</p>
<div>
<p>The quiz was produced to coincide with the opening of the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/events/twobraggs/">Two Braggs Exhibition at the University of Warwick</a> in August 2013.</p>
