<p>X-ray diffraction is a key technique to working out the molecular structure of compounds. This is vital to be able to gain insight into such things as developing new materials to work in electronic <a href="http://learn.crystallography.org.uk/learn-crystallography/devices/">devices</a> or to help understand the <a href="http://learn.crystallography.org.uk/learn-crystallography/medicine/">structure and property of new drug compounds</a>.  These pages have been designed to give insight and links to chemistry resources with a key aspect being related to the compounds structural information.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">AS and A2 Level</strong></p>
<p>Link to some <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/chemistry/outreach/ccdc/index.htm">learning and teaching resources</a> from a collaboration between the Department of Chemistry at the University of Newcastle and the CCDC.  There are over 40 resources covering fundamental topics at both AS and A2 level, where viewing 3D molecular structures is key to understanding the principles.</p>
