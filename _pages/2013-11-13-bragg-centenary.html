<p>This website initially developed in 2013/4 as a focus for outreach and education during the Bragg Centenary and International Year of Crystallography events. We have changed our focus to support this type of work more broadly, but the pages below serve as a legacy from that time...</p>

<p>In 2013 it was 100 years since the pioneering work undertaken by William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, which underpins the discipline of X-ray crystallography, and for which they were jointly awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915. By formulating the relationship between a crystal’s atomic structure and its X-ray diffraction pattern they provided a tool which has revolutionised our understanding of the structure of matter ranging from minerals, pharmaceutical materials, and catalysts to DNA, proteins and viruses.</p>
<p>As part of the celebrations for this centenary, an exhibition was created and displayed in the Warwick Arts Centre from the 25th - 31st August 2013.  The exhibition contained a lot of historical documents and letters from the early work of the Braggs, along with work from many of their colleagues.  It contained  equipment that they used along with models and electron density maps that were created from some of the early structure solutions.  The exhibition was fantastic, bringing together such a wide array of artefacts<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, the the catalogue of The Two Braggs Exhibition can be found <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/suppl/10.1080/0889311X.2013.861634/suppl_file/gcry_a_861634_sm5538.pdf">here</a>, and a <a href="http://www.amg122.com/twobraggs/index.html">website</a> has been put together to celebrate the exhibition.<br />
