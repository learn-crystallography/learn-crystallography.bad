<p>After learning about <a href="http://learn.crystallography.org.uk/learn-crystallography/what-is-a-crystal/">what a crystal is</a>, we can then use this information to understand how we can study crystals to obtain the structure of a material at the molecular level.  The technique of X-ray diffraction relies on the fact that the molecules or atoms within a crystal are ordered, and this makes it possible for the X-rays to be diffracted when they hit the crystal.</p>
<p>The best way to try and understand how diffraction works is by watching this video...</p>
<p>[youtube_sc url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRZ7cSP1zMM"]</p>
<p>In this video wires are used to demonstrate how a wave of light interacts when hitting these wires.  If this is then related to a crystal, the wires represent planes of atoms or molecules within a crystal, and the laser represents our X-ray beam.  When the X-rays hit our crystal, they interact in a similar manner and the resulting diffraction image can be collected.  X-ray waves are not visible by the human eye, and so special detectors which are sensitive to X-ray light have to be used.  The image below is the typical type of X-ray diffraction pattern that might be expected when exposing a crystal to X-rays.</p>

<p>We use the positional information about the spots, and also the difference in intensities between spots to work back from the image to gain 3D structural information about the crystal we are investigating.  Once hundreds or thousands of these images have been collected with the crystal in different positions an electron density map can be produced which gives us knowledge about the positions of atoms.  Once the electron density map is obtained atoms can be assigned into the appropriate positions, building up a 3D atomic picture of the structure that has been investigated.</p>

<p>The technology used to study crystals by diffraction has advanced dramatically over the last 100 years since the Bragg's first did their experiments.  Universities will have the own X-ray sources and diffractometers to collect data on crystals in their lab.  Further advances also mean that people can collect data on crystals at synchrotron sources such as the <a href="http://www.diamond.ac.uk/">Diamond Light Source</a> in Oxfordshire.  This allows even smaller crystals with more complicated structures to be studied, which have never previously been possible.</p>
