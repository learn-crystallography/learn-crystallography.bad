<p>The primary purpose of the British Crystallographic Association (BCA) is to advance the education of the public in the science of crystallography.  This website aims to provide access to different crystallographic resources that can be used to help with learning and teaching about crystallography.   It will also contain information about upcoming and past events that are taking place around the UK related to crystallography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The educational remit of the BCA is coordinated by the <a title="Education and Outreach Coordinators" href="http://learn.crystallography.org.uk/about-us/education-and-outreach-coordinators/">BCA Education and Outreach Coordinators</a>.  Please use the contact form below to get in touch with the coordinators with any crystallographic events you have planned and would like advertising on this website, or if you have any queries.</p>
