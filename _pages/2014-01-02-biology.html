<p>X-ray diffraction is the gold star technique in elucidating the structure of many biological molecules such as proteins, viruses and DNA.  Having this 3D information about a material enables scientists to gain vital information about the function of these molecules.  The<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do"> Protein Data Bank</a> (PDB) is a repository for biological structures that have been discovered, and is freely accessible on the internet, with almost 100,000 structures to date!</p>
<p>Some of the early work on biological molecules was from Rosalind Franklin in the 1950s, she collected X-ray diffraction photographs of DNA and showed that the molecule in fact forms a helical structure.  This work was also later confirmed by James Watson and Francis Crick who won the Nobel prize for this work in 1962.</p>

<p>You can have a go at creating your own diffraction pattern of DNA following these simple <a href="http://www.t2ah.com/2013/02/number-25-dna-diffraction-with-spring.html?m=1">instructions</a>.  You can also take on the challenge of making your own<a href="http://www.yourgenome.org/teachers/origami.shtml"> model of DNA</a> using origami!</p>
<p>Since this work on DNA, many thousands of structures have been determined on even more complicated biological molecules.  Many of these have been on protein structures, to understand how they function within the body.  Ever wondered what a protein is, and why knowing the structure is so important?  Then check out this edition of the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Education-resources/Education-and-learning/Big-Picture/All-issues/Proteins/index.htm">Big Picture on proteins</a> and watch this video...</p>
<p>[youtube_sc url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBRFIMcxZNM"]</p>
<p>Proteins can also be found in other organisms, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), which was first isolated from jelly fish.  From the structure, biologists were able to determine that the molecule adopts a barrel-like structure which contains a chromophore in the center, it is this chromophore which causes the protein to fluoresce green light.  Due to this signaling behaviour of GFP it is now used as a tool in genetic engineering, individual proteins can be tagged and can then be monitored within cells.  The 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien for their discovery and development of GFP.</p>
<p>You can find out more information about GFP <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/pdb/101/static101.do?p=education_discussion/educational_resources/GFP_activity.html">here</a>, as well as having a go at building your own <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/education_discussion/educational_resources/gfp-model.pdf">paper model of the protein</a>.  There is also a <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/education_discussion/educational_resources/gfp-bioinformatics-tutorial-summer2010.pdf">bioinformatics tutorial available</a> on GFP to explain the relationship between gene sequence, protein structure and biological function.</p>

<p>As technology over the years has developed even more complicated structures have been determined from X-ray crystallography, such as those of <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/education_discussion/educational_resources/viruses-shapes-sizes.pdf">viruses</a>.  Viruses can cause a variety of diseases such as the common cold and flu, to more serious illnesses such as <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/education_discussion/educational_resources/struct_bio_hiv_lores.pdf">HIV</a>, measles and dengue fever.  If we can understand the biology and structure of these viruses, then it may be possible to develop new treatments against them.</p>
<p>Paper models are available to build your own <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/education_discussion/educational_resources/dengue_virus_3Dmodel.pdf">dengue virus</a> and <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/education_discussion/educational_resources/hiv_capsid_3Dmodel_0.pdf">HIV capsid</a>, as well as an accompanying <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/education_discussion/educational_resources/life-cycle-dengue.pdf">lesson plan</a> on dengue virus to learn about viruses and their life cycles, as well how viruses assemble and how they infect.</p>
